if you click the 'start timer' then the work timer will go first, if you click it again it wil pause both timers.

if you put 10 on seconds and 1 on minute than it will change to 1:10 but if you have a timer with 1:5 and you change the seconds only then only the seconds will only change

if you click the reset than it will reset the timer to the original timer
